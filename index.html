                <h1 class="question">In Europe, large alcon blue butterflies can be seen flitting about in the summer, but like many butterfly species, their populations have declined recently due to habitat fragmentation and loss.  This particular species is especially sensitive to such changes because it has a kind of particular diet during its last larval stage which relies on the presence of another species.  When they're separated from that species, they die because their caterpillars can't get the special food without it.  Of course, that species isn't exactly a willing participant in all of this, so the question is, what biological trick do these caterpillars use to get their special meals? Do they:</h1>

                    <li class="right-answer">produce chemicals that get ants to regurgitate their food</li>
                    <li class="wrong-answer">sneak around at night so they can eat honeycombs without the bees noticing</li>
                    <li class="wrong-answer">look like leaves so they can ambush flies</li>
                    <li class="wrong-answer">poop out compounds that lower the defenses of their host plants</li>

                <h1 class="question">In the jungles of Central and South America, communication is key, especially for small social animals like the endangered pied tamarin monkey.  Little baby tamarins are especially vulnerable since only the alpha female breeds, the whole group takes care of her babies, so all tamarins react when they hear a baby tamarin in distress, but sometimes, what sounds like the cry of a baby monkey is actually something very different.  In 2005, researchers observed something that was definitely not a baby tamarin making the same call near a band of adults.  Was it:</h1>

                <h1 class="question">Herons, like a lot of other birds, are super smart, which is part of what makes them such great hunters.  For example, they can stand motionless for unbelievable amounts of time, waiting for a fish or frog to make the wrong move, but herons aren't always patient enough to wait for their prey to come within striking distance, and they've developed a special strategy that they can use to catch fish.  How do they do it?  Do they:</h1>

They are called flap track fairings because they contain the mechanism that moves the flaps on the wings, but they also have another important job.

                <h1 class="question">Airplane windows are actually made up of three panes of glass.  There's the one on the inside, which is basically a cheap layer that is meant to be the one that gets all scratched up, and then there are two on the outside of the plane that are both built to withstand all the stress that comes with being an airplane window.  It's a hard job, but have you ever noticed that there's a little hole at the bottom of the window through the two inner panes of glass?  Why is that there?</h1>
